## Pre-Workshop Setup (Send 1 day before)

### Participant Checklist

- [ ] VS Code installed with latest updates
- [ ] GitHub Copilot extension activated
- [ ] GitHub Copilot Chat extension activated
- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed (`node --version`)
- [ ] Repository cloned locally
- [ ] Dependencies installed (`npm install`)

### Install Testing Framework

Run these commands before the workshop:

```bash
cd 401k-portal
npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jsdom happy-dom
```

### Custom Chat Modes

The repository already includes four custom chat modes in `.github/chatmodes/`:
- `plan.chatmode.md` - Strategic planning and architecture
- `tdd-red.chatmode.md` - Write failing tests
- `tdd-green.chatmode.md` - Minimal implementation
- `tdd-refactor.chatmode.md` - Quality improvements

These custom chat modes are based on examples from the [Awesome Copilot repository](https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot), a community-driven collection of Copilot prompts, chat modes, and instructions. Visit this repository to find more examples and contribute your own!

After cloning, restart VS Code to load these modes.

**How to use custom chat modes:**
1. Open Copilot Chat (Cmd+I or Ctrl+I)
2. Click the chat mode dropdown at the top of the Chat view
3. Select the desired mode from the list (e.g., "plan", "tdd-red")
4. The mode will stay active until you switch to a different mode

### Prompt Files

The repository also includes reusable prompt files in `.github/prompts/`:
- Ready-to-use prompts for each workshop section
- Automatically set the appropriate chat mode (ask, agent, etc.)
- Can be referenced instead of copying/pasting prompts

**How to use prompt files:**
1. Open Copilot Chat (Cmd+I or Ctrl+I)
2. Type `/` followed by the prompt file name (e.g., `/part2-demo-red-balance-validation`)
3. The prompt will run with its configured mode automatically

See `.github/prompts/README.md` for a complete list of available prompts.

## Part 1: Setup & Introduction (10 minutes)

### Welcome & Objectives (5 min)

**Today's Goal:** Transform Copilot from code completion to development partner

**You'll Learn:**
1. ‚úÖ Write tests first with Copilot's TDD modes
2. ‚úÖ Let Copilot implement minimal code to pass tests
3. ‚úÖ Refactor to production quality
4. ‚úÖ Use Plan mode for strategic architecture planning
5. ‚úÖ Leverage Agent Mode to implement features autonomously

### The TDD Workflow (5 min)

```
üî¥ RED Phase (tdd-red mode)
   Write ONE failing test that describes behavior
   ‚Üì
üü¢ GREEN Phase (tdd-green mode)  
   Write minimal code to make it pass
   ‚Üì
üîµ REFACTOR Phase (tdd-refactor mode)
   Improve code quality, keep tests green
   ‚Üì
   Repeat for next behavior
```

**Key Rule:** Never skip a phase. Trust the process.

**How to switch modes:** Use the chat mode dropdown at the top of Chat view to select tdd-red, tdd-green, or tdd-refactor.

---

## Part 2: TDD Fundamentals + Demo (20 minutes)

### Live Demo: Balance Validation (20 min)

**Facilitator demonstrates the full cycle:**

#### üî¥ RED: Write Failing Test

1. Open Copilot Chat (Cmd+I or Ctrl+I)
2. Click the chat mode dropdown and select **"tdd-red"**
3. Provide requirements:

```
I need to validate that the total account balance equals the sum of all fund balances.

Requirements:
- Calculate total from array of funds
- Each fund has a balance property
- Return the sum as a number
- Handle empty arrays (return 0)

Help me write ONE failing test for the basic happy path case.
Create the test file at: src/utils/__tests__/accountBalance.test.js
```

4. Review Copilot's suggested test
5. Create file: `src/utils/__tests__/accountBalance.test.js`
6. Run test: It should FAIL ‚ùå

**Expected Test:**
```javascript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { calculateTotalBalance } from '../accountBalance';

describe('calculateTotalBalance', () => {
  it('should sum all fund balances', () => {
    const funds = [
      { name: 'Fund A', balance: 1000 },
      { name: 'Fund B', balance: 2000 },
      { name: 'Fund C', balance: 3000 }
    ];
    
    expect(calculateTotalBalance(funds)).toBe(6000);
  });
});
```

#### üü¢ GREEN: Minimal Implementation

1. Switch to TDD-Green mode: Click the chat mode dropdown and select **"tdd-green"**
2. Reference the failing test:

```
I have a failing test in src/utils/__tests__/accountBalance.test.js
for the calculateTotalBalance function.

Help me write the minimal code to make it pass. 
Create src/utils/accountBalance.js
```

3. Review implementation
4. Create the file
5. Run test: It should PASS ‚úÖ

**Expected Implementation:**
```javascript
export function calculateTotalBalance(funds) {
  return funds.reduce((sum, fund) => sum + fund.balance, 0);
}
```

#### üîµ REFACTOR: Improve Quality

1. Switch to TDD-Refactor mode: Click the chat mode dropdown and select **"tdd-refactor"**
2. Request improvements:

```
Here's my working code with passing tests in:
- Implementation: src/utils/accountBalance.js
- Tests: src/utils/__tests__/accountBalance.test.js

Refactor to improve:
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Documentation
- Edge case handling

Keep tests green!
```

3. Review suggestions
4. Apply incrementally
5. Run tests after each change: Stay GREEN ‚úÖ

**Expected Refactored Code:**
```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the total balance across all funds
 * @param {Array<{balance: number}>} funds - Array of fund objects
 * @returns {number} Total balance
 * @throws {Error} If funds is not an array or contains invalid balances
 */
export function calculateTotalBalance(funds) {
  if (!Array.isArray(funds)) {
    throw new Error('Funds must be an array');
  }
  
  return funds.reduce((sum, fund) => {
    const balance = Number(fund.balance);
    if (isNaN(balance)) {
      throw new Error(`Invalid balance for fund: ${fund.name || 'unknown'}`);
    }
    return sum + balance;
  }, 0);
}
```

**Key Takeaways:**
- Each phase has a specific purpose
- Custom chat modes keep you focused
- Tests drive the design
- Refactor only when tests are green

## Part 3: Hands-On TDD Exercise (40 minutes)

### Exercise: Fund Transfer Validation

**Work in Pairs - Switch roles after each test**

**User Story:**
```
As a 401k account holder
I want the system to prevent invalid fund transfers
So that I protect my retirement savings

Acceptance Criteria:
‚úÖ Cannot transfer more than available balance
‚úÖ Cannot transfer negative or zero amounts  
‚úÖ Cannot transfer to/from the same fund
‚úÖ Must validate source and destination funds exist
‚úÖ Transfer amount must be a valid number
```

### Pair Roles

**Driver:** Controls keyboard, uses Copilot
**Navigator:** Reviews suggestions, manages TDD cycle

### Step-by-Step Process (40 min total)

#### Round 1: Balance Validation (12 min)

**Navigator says:** "Let's start with the first criteria - can't transfer more than balance"

**Driver does:**

1. **üî¥ RED Phase (4 min)**
   - Switch to **tdd-red** mode using the chat mode dropdown
   - Use this prompt:
   
   ```
   I need to validate fund transfers.
   First requirement: Cannot transfer more than available balance.
   
   Help me write ONE failing test for this scenario.
   File: src/utils/__tests__/transferValidation.test.js
   ```

2. Create test file with Copilot's suggestion
3. Run test - should FAIL ‚ùå
4. **Switch roles**

5. **üü¢ GREEN Phase (4 min)**
   - Switch to **tdd-green** mode using the chat mode dropdown
   - Use this prompt:
   
   ```
   I have a failing test in src/utils/__tests__/transferValidation.test.js
   for validating fund transfers.
   
   Create minimal implementation in src/utils/transferValidation.js
   ```

6. Create implementation file
7. Run test - should PASS ‚úÖ
8. **Switch roles**

9. **üîµ REFACTOR Phase (4 min)**
   - Switch to **tdd-refactor** mode using the chat mode dropdown
   - Use this prompt:
   
   ```
   I have working code in src/utils/transferValidation.js with passing tests.
   
   Focus on: error messages, input validation
   ```

10. Apply improvements incrementally
11. Run tests - stay GREEN ‚úÖ
12. Commit: `git add . && git commit -m "feat: validate transfer balance"`

#### Round 2: Amount Validation (12 min)

**Repeat the same process for:**
- Requirement: Cannot transfer negative or zero amounts
- **üî¥ RED:** Write failing test
- **üü¢ GREEN:** Minimal implementation
- **üîµ REFACTOR:** Improve quality
- Commit when green

#### Round 3: Same Fund Check (12 min)

**Repeat for:**
- Requirement: Cannot transfer to/from the same fund
- Follow full RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- Commit when done

#### Group Share-Out (4 min)

Each pair shares:
- What surprised you?
- Where did Copilot excel?
- Where did you need to guide it?

## Part 4: Architecture & Agent Mode Demo (20 minutes)

### Architecture Discussion with Copilot (10 min)

**Scenario:** Plan a new "Contribution Calculator" feature

**Facilitator demonstrates:**

1. Start architectural conversation:
```
I need to design a contribution calculator for our 401k portal.

Requirements:
- Calculate future balance based on current balance + monthly contributions
- Include employer match (percentage)
- Show year-by-year projection
- Account for compound interest

Let's discuss the architecture:
1. What components do we need?
2. How should data flow?
3. What calculations are required?
4. What validation is needed?

Don't write code yet - just help me think through the design.
```

2. Have conversation with Copilot
3. Ask follow-up questions
4. Request a Mermaid diagram:

```
Create a Mermaid component diagram showing:
- Component structure
- Data flow
- Key functions

Keep it simple and clear.
```

5. Show the generated diagram
6. Ask for alternative approaches:

```
What are the pros and cons of:
1. Calculating on frontend vs backend
2. Using a financial library vs custom calculations
3. State management approaches
```

### Agent Mode Demo (10 min)

**What is Agent Mode?**
- Copilot executes multi-step tasks autonomously
- Navigates files, runs tests, makes edits
- Iterates until successful

**When to use:**
- Complex refactoring across multiple files
- Debugging unfamiliar code
- Generating comprehensive documentation
- Implementing well-scoped features

**Facilitator demonstrates:**

1. Enable Agent Mode:
   - Click the chat mode dropdown in the Chat view
   - Select **"Agent"** from the list
   
2. Give a complex task:
```
Refactor the BalanceMatrix component:
1. Extract calculation logic into a separate utility
2. Add PropTypes or type comments
3. Improve accessibility (ARIA labels)
4. Add error boundary
5. Ensure existing functionality still works

Make the changes and verify nothing breaks.
```

3. Watch as Agent:
   - Analyzes the component
   - Creates a refactoring plan
   - Makes changes step-by-step
   - Runs any available tests
   - Reports completion

4. Review the changes
5. Show how to approve/reject steps

**Key Points:**
- You stay in control
- Can stop at any time
- Review each change
- Great for tedious but well-defined tasks
