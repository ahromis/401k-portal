- Historical Performance Tracking
- Multi-Fund Optimization

### Hands-On First

The workshop is 70% hands-on practice:
- 40 minutes: Pair programming TDD exercise
- 15 minutes: Group feature building
- Only 35 minutes of demonstration/lecture

### Comprehensive Materials

Participants get:
- Detailed workshop guide for review

## üí° Unique Aspects

### Built for This Repo

All examples use the actual 401k-portal codebase:
- Real components (BalanceMatrix, LoginPage)
- Actual business rules
- Relevant features to implement
- Team's technology stack (React, Vite, Vitest)

### Scaffolded Learning

Exercises progressively build skills:
1. Start with one test (balance validation)
2. Add complexity (transfer validation)
3. Multiple criteria (rebalancing rules)
4. Full features (contribution calculator)

### Safe to Experiment

- Pre-configured testing environment
- Clear rollback instructions
- Git commits after each cycle
- Can't break production code

### Measurable Outcomes

By end of workshop, every participant should:
- [ ] Complete at least one full RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- [ ] Use all three custom chat modes
- [ ] Write at least 3 tests
- [ ] Have a working, tested feature
- [ ] Feel confident to try TDD on next story
