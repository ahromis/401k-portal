# TDD Red: Balance Validation

I need to validate that the total account balance equals the sum of all fund balances.

Requirements:
- Calculate total from array of funds
- Each fund has a balance property
- Return the sum as a number
- Handle empty arrays (return 0)

Help me write ONE failing test for the basic happy path case.
Create the test file at: src/utils/__tests__/accountBalance.test.js
