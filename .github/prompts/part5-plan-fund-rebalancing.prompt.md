# Architecture Planning: Fund Rebalancing

I'm building a Fund Rebalancing feature for a 401k portal.

Requirements:
- Input target % for each fund
- Validate percentages sum to 100%
- Calculate required transfers
- Show preview of changes
- Minimum transfer is $1

Let's discuss the architecture:
1. What validation functions do we need?
2. How do we calculate the transfer amounts?
3. What's the order of operations?
4. What edge cases should we handle?

Don't write code yet - help me plan the approach.
