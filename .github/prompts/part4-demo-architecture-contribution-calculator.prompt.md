# Architecture Discussion: Contribution Calculator

I need to design a contribution calculator for our 401k portal.

Requirements:
- Calculate future balance based on current balance + monthly contributions
- Include employer match (percentage)
- Show year-by-year projection
- Account for compound interest

Let's discuss the architecture:
1. What components do we need?
2. How should data flow?
3. What calculations are required?
4. What validation is needed?

Don't write code yet - just help me think through the design.
