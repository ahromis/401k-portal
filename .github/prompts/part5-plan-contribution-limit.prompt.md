# Architecture Planning: Contribution Limit Tracker

I'm building a Contribution Limit Tracker for a 401k portal.

Requirements:
- Show year-to-date contributions
- Display IRS limit for 2025 ($23,000)
- Calculate remaining room
- Show catch-up contribution if age 50+ ($7,500)
- Alert when over 90% of limit

Let's discuss the architecture:
1. What functions do we need?
2. What calculations are required?
3. What should we test first?
4. How should we structure the data?

Don't write code yet - help me plan the approach.
