# Architecture Planning: Performance Dashboard

I'm building a Performance Dashboard for a 401k portal.

Requirements:
- Show 1-year return percentage
- Compare to S&P 500 benchmark
- Display best/worst performing fund
- Show contribution vs growth breakdown

Let's discuss the architecture:
1. What performance calculations do we need?
2. How do we compare to benchmark?
3. What components/functions should we create?
4. What data structure makes sense?

Don't write code yet - help me plan the approach.
