Hi Team,

I'm excited for our GitHub Copilot workshop on **[Date] at [Time]**! We're going to go beyond basic autocomplete and learn to use Copilot for test-driven development, architecture planning, and automated refactoring.

### üéØ What to Expect

We'll spend 2 hours learning through hands-on exercises:
- Writing tests first with Copilot's TDD modes
- Implementing features using the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- Having architecture discussions with AI
- Using Agent Mode for complex refactoring

You'll work in pairs and small groups on real features from our 401k-portal codebase.

### ‚úÖ Required Setup (Please Complete Before the Workshop!)

**This is important** - we'll start coding immediately, so please have everything ready:

1. **Verify GitHub Copilot Access**
   - Open VS Code and check for Copilot icon in status bar
   - If not active, sign in with your GitHub account
   - Contact [IT contact] if you don't have access

2. **Install Required Extensions**

   - GitHub Copilot Chat
   - Vitest (recommended)

3. **Clone and Setup Repository**

   cd 401k-portal
   npm install
   npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jsdom happy-dom @vitest/ui
   ```

4. **Verify Everything Works**
   ```bash
   npm run dev  # Should open on localhost:5173
