# Workshop Participant Setup Guide

## Pre-Workshop Setup (Do This Before the Workshop!)

### 1. Verify GitHub Copilot Access

1. Open VS Code
2. Check bottom-right status bar for Copilot icon
3. Click the icon to verify it's active
4. If not active, sign in with your GitHub account

### 2. Install Required Extensions

Open VS Code and install:

- **GitHub Copilot** - AI pair programmer
- **GitHub Copilot Chat** - Conversational AI assistant
- **Vitest** (optional but recommended) - Test runner UI

Quick install via command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`):
```
ext install GitHub.copilot
ext install GitHub.copilot-chat
ext install vitest.explorer
```

### 3. Clone and Setup Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ahromis/401k-portal.git
cd 401k-portal

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install testing dependencies
npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jsdom happy-dom @vitest/ui

# Verify setup works
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
```

### 4. Verify Testing Setup

```bash
# Run tests (there may not be any yet - that's OK!)
npm run test

# You should see Vitest start without errors
```

### 5. Load Custom Chat Modes

The repository includes three custom TDD chat modes:

1. Close VS Code completely
2. Reopen the `401k-portal` folder
3. Restart VS Code if the custom modes don't appear

To verify they loaded:
1. Open Copilot Chat (`Cmd+I` or `Ctrl+I`)
2. Type `@` and you should see:
   - `@tdd-red`
   - `@tdd-green`
   - `@tdd-refactor`

### 6. Optional: Install Recommended Extensions

For the best experience, also install:

- **Error Lens** - Inline error highlighting
- **GitLens** - Enhanced Git integration
- **Better Comments** - Highlight TODO, FIXME, etc.
